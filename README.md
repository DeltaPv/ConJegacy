A tool that lets Minecraft 3ds (1.9.19) connect to a Minecraft Java edition server. ( Most likely 1.8.9, or maybe 1.9)
the first release will most likey only suport 1 3ds player and 1 java player, due the the multiplayer in the 3ds version ownly having 2 player suport. I will need to find a way around this. there will also be 2 versions, the first will be bunnge cord so you can connect to a external server. and the second will have a server built in to the gui.
I dont have a planned release date, I am curently a solo developer so more devs would speed it up.
